			<p>A <b>“Drone”</b> is basically an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) – an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. In this article, we explore the different types of drones out there in the market – some of which are just concepts, while most others are already in action.</p>
			<p><b>“Drones”</b> can be classified on a different basis – say based on <tt>‘usage‘</tt> like Drones for Photography, Drones for aerial Mapping, Drones for Surveillance etc. However, the best classificationÂ of ‘Drones’ can be made on the basis of aerial platforms. Based on the type of aerial platform used, there are 4 major types of drones.</p>

			<h2 class="sub_title"><b>Multi Rotor Drones</b></h2>

			<p>
				Multi Rotor drones are the most common types of drones which are used by professionals and hobbyists alike. They are used for most common applications like aerial photography, aerial video surveillance etc. Different types of products are available in this segment in the market – say multi-rotor drones for professional uses like aerial photography (whose price may range from Rs. 10K to Rs. 10L INR) and there are lots of variants for hobby purposes like amateur drone racing, or leisure flying (price range from Rs. 1K to Rs. 20K INR). Out of all the 4 drone types (based on aerial platform), multi-rotor drones are the easiest to manufacture and they are the cheapest option available as well.

			<h2 class="sub_title"><b>Fixed Wing Drones</b></h2>
			
			<p>
				Fixed Wing drones are entirely different in design and build to multi-rotor type drones. They use a ‘wing’ like the normal airplanes out there. Unlike multi-rotor drones, fixed wing type models never utilize energy to stay afloat on air (fixed wing types can’t stand still on the air) fighting gravity. Instead, they move forward on their set course or as set by the guide control (possibly a remote unit operated by a human) as long as their energy source permits.
			</p>

			</div>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Most fixed wing drones have an average flying time of a couple of hours. Gas engine powered drones can fly up to 16 hours or higher. Owing to their higher flying time and fuel efficiency, fixed wing drones are ideal for long distance operations (be it mapping or surveillance). But they can not be used for aerial photography where the drone needs to be kept still on the air for a period of time.
			</p>
			<br/>
			
			<h2 class="sub_title"><b>Single Rotor Dones</b></h2>
			
			<p>
				Single rotor drones look very similar in design & structure to actual helicopters. Unlike a multi rotor drone, a single roter model has just one big sized rotor plus a small sized one on the tail of the drone to control its heading. Single rotor drones are much efficient than multi rotor versions. They have higher flying times and can even be powered by gas engines. In aerodynamics, the lower the count of rotors the lesser will be the spin of the object. Â And that’s the big reason why quadcopters are more stable than octocopters. In that sense, single rotor drones are much efficient than multi-rotor drones.

			<br/>
			<p>
				However, these machines comes with much higher complexity and operational risks. Their costs are also on the higher side.
			</p>
			<br/>
			
			<h2 class="sub_title"><b>Hybrid VTOL</b></h2>
			
			<p>
				These are hybrid versions combining the benefits of Fixed wing models (higher flying time) with that of rotor based models (hover). This concept has been tested from around 1960’s without much success. However, with the advent of new generation sensors (gyros and accelerometers), this concept has got some new life and direction.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<div>
				<img src="data/images/pic4.jpg" class="img_class1" title="Hybrid VTOL" alt="Hybrid VTOL:no image" />
			</div>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Hybrid VTOL’s are a play of automation and manual gliding. A vertical lift is used to lift the drone up into the air from the ground. Gyros and accelerometers work in automated mode (autopilot concept) to keep the drone stabilized in the air. Remote based (or even programmed) manual control is used to guide the drone on the desired course.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There are some versions of this hybrid fixed wing models available in the market. However, the most popular one is drone used in Amazon commercials (for its Prime delivery service).
