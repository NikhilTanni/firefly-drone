			<p>Drone is a technology that has emerged with rise in Un-manned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). UAV means, the aerial vehicle will fly without any man physically present inside. It can fly by person using remote control. So, Drone is a flying robot that can be controlled remotely (using remote control) or autonomous flight using software configurations.</p>
			<p>UAV’s began the journey with military applications where they were mainly used for air-activity, intelligence gathering and eventually they’ve expanded their uses in rescue operations, weather monitor, firefighting, agriculture and the most expanding in current day – the photography and videography.</p>
			<br/>

			<h2 class="sub_title"><b>History: The Drone History</b></h2>

			<p>
				<b>1839</b>: The earliest UAV was seen in 1839. Austrian Soldiers attacked the city of Venice with these un-manned air explosives. The balloons that were filled with explosives were the first time when the UAV’s appeared. Some of these balloons were successful, but lot many blew back and exploded in Austrians own lines. So this method/practice were not adopted widely.
			</p>

			<p>
				The invention of winged aircraft changed everything for manned and unmanned vehicles alike.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Wright Brothers First Flight</b>: The Wright Brothers’ famous Kitty Hawk flight was in the autumn of 1900, and only 16 years later Great Britain developed the first pilotless winged aircraft: the Ruston Proctor Aerial Target. The Aerial Target was based on designs by Nikola Tesla and was controlled with radio control much like the drones of today (though the technology was much more rudimentary.)

			<p>
				<tt>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</tt> After several revisions and evolutions, the modern drone era began.<br/>
			</P>

			<p>
				UAV technology improved throughout World War II (which saw a number of technological advancements as we all know) and into the Cold War as well.
			</p>

			<p>
				Modern military drones typically serve one of two purposes:<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>•	The first is combat surveillance, in which a human pilot uses radio control to fly a drone to different waypoints to scan and mark enemy positions.</li>
					<li>•	The second is tactical reconnaissance, in which a mini drone (not much larger than the commercial drones we write about here in most cases) flies on autopilot to predesignated targets to take pictures before returning to a home base.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				As unmanned aerial vehicle technology improved in the military sector, those same technological improvements could be used in the private sector.
			</p>

			<p>
				However, you may be surprised to hear that recreational drone use actually only took off (pun intended) very recently, and it’s grown fast. One of the main reasons for this is that the Federal Aviation Administration had to be convinced that commercial drones were safe to allow and determine proper regulatory measures.
			</p>

			<h2 class="sub_title"><b>Where Drones are going to?</b></h2>

				<img src="data/images/pic3.png" class="img_class1" title="Future of Drones" alt="Future of Drones:no image" />
			</div>
			<br/>

			<p>
				Now that the technology of Drones and Drones itself are growing exponentially, we can only guess what would future Drones look like or what they are capable of. The drones may be launched as commercial taxi vehicles, courier delivery drones or what more. The technology develops day by day so that better products comes out to reach of people.
